Welcome to Building Tales 2! With mods such as AgriTech, Macaw's Furniture, and Horseman you can build anything such as a stable as horses are improved due to Horseman. So you can use your horse to get around the world where you builds reside and explore without getting off your horse much as horses can swim and much more! With AgriTech, you can build a greenhouse and mass produce crops you may want to grow and decorate your builds with Macaw's Furniture. It is highly encouraged that you use horses to get around your world, by yourself or with your peers!

**__Special Thanks__**

I want to give credit to [MaTik](https://www.curseforge.com/members/matik/projects) for allowing the use of [Farmer GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/farmergui) in the pack!
